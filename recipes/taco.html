    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These classic beef tacos are a delicious and satisfying option for a quick and flavorful meal. Seasoned ground beef is nestled in soft corn tortillas and topped with a vibrant array of toppings, creating a perfect balance of textures and flavors.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup beef broth or water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef, breaking it up with a spatula as it cooks, until it's no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion to the beef and cook for a few more minutes until the onion is translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in the minced garlic, chili powder, ground cumin, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Cook for another minute until the spices are fragrant.</li>
        <li>Pour in the beef broth or water, and let the mixture simmer for about 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the liquid to reduce. Adjust seasoning if needed.</li>
        <li>While the beef filling is simmering, warm the corn tortillas. You can do this by heating them briefly in a dry skillet or in the oven wrapped in aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>To assemble each taco, place a spoonful of the seasoned beef filling onto the center of a corn tortilla.</li>
        <li>Top the beef filling with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, grated cheddar cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and sliced jalape√±os if desired.</li>
        <li>Garnish the tacos with chopped fresh cilantro and serve with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over the tacos.</li>
        <li>Repeat the assembly process for the remaining tortillas.</li>
        <li>Serve the classic beef tacos immediately while they're still warm and all the toppings are fresh.</li>
    </ol>
